    "The decision tree classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "It creates a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. \n",
    "The decision tree classifier algorithm works in a step-by-step manner, and here's a high-level overview of how it operates:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preparation: The algorithm starts with a dataset consisting of labeled examples, where each example contains a set of features\n",
    "(also known as attributes) and a corresponding target value or class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: The algorithm determines which features to consider for making decisions. It selects the most informative features \n",
    "that can provide the best split points in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building the Tree: The algorithm constructs the decision tree by recursively partitioning the data based on the selected features.\n",
    "It uses a top-down approach, where it starts with the root node representing the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the Best Feature: At each node, the algorithm evaluates different features to find the one that best separates the data into\n",
    "different classes. It calculates a metric, such as information gain or Gini impurity, to quantify the effectiveness of each feature in splitting \n",
    "the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting the Node: Once the best feature is selected, the node is split into multiple child nodes, each corresponding to a specific feature value. \n",
    "The data is divided based on these feature values, and the process continues recursively for each child node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopping Criteria: The algorithm continues building the tree until a stopping criterion is met. This criterion could be a predefined depth limit,\n",
    "a minimum number of samples required to split a node, or a minimum improvement in the metric used for splitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaf Node Assignment: When a stopping criterion is reached, the algorithm assigns a class label to the leaf nodes. For classification tasks,\n",
    "this could be the majority class of the samples in that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction: Once the decision tree is built, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. Starting from the root node, the features \n",
    "of the input data are compared with the learned decision rules at each node. The prediction is made by following the path down the tree until a \n",
    "leaf node is reached, which provides the predicted class or value.\n",

    "The decision tree classifier algorithm is known for its interpretability, as the resulting tree structure can be visualized and understood by humans.\n",
